# Waste Segregation - A waste classifier app


## WHY THIS APP ?


#### Every year tons of waste is produced by houses and industries and handling the waste for the Municipal corporations gets a bit hectic as well as tedious because the waste is not segregated based on its nature. 

#### This app will help them in segregating the waste materials, also make the segregation of material little less time consuming. 

#### In the future this product can be scaled to a larger number of classes of segregation and can be implemented using IoT also.
